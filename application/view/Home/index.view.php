<p><b>'.__('Biological diversity - or biodiversity - is a term we use to describe the variety of life on Earth. It refers to the wide variety of ecosystems and living organisms: animals, plants, their habitats and their genes.').'</b></p>
<p>'.__('Biodiversity is the foundation of life on Earth. It is crucial for the functioning of ecosystems which provide us with products and services without which we couldn’t live. Oxygen, food, fresh water, fertile soil, medicines, shelter, protection from storms and floods, stable climate and recreation - all have their source in nature and healthy ecosystems. But biodiversity gives us much more than this. We depend on it for our security and health; it strongly affects our social relations and gives us freedom and choice.').'</p>
<p>'.__('Biodiversity is extremely complex, dynamic and varied like no other feature of the Earth. Its innumerable plants, animals and microbes physically and chemically unite the atmosphere (the mixture of gases around the Earth), geosphere (the solid part of the Earth), and hydrosphere (the Earth\'s water, ice and water vapour) into one environmental system which makes it possible for millions of species, including people, to exist.').'</p>
<p>'.__('At the same time, no other feature of the Earth has been so dramatically influenced by man’s activities. By changing biodiversity, we strongly affect human well-being and the well-being of every other living creature.').'</p>
</li>
<li><h4>'.__('Where is biodiversity and how can we measure it?').'</h4>
<p>'.__('Biodiversity is everywhere. It occurs both on land and in water, from high altitudes to deep ocean trenches and it includes all organisms, from microscopic bacteria to more complex plants. Although many tools and data sources have been developed, biodiversity remains difficult to measure precisely. According to the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment, the total number of species on Earth ranges from five to 30 million and only 1.7–2 million species have been formally identified.').'</p>
<p>'.__('But we do not need precise figures and answers to devise an effective understanding of where biodiversity is, how it is changing over space and time, what are the drivers responsible for this change, its consequences for ecosystem services and human well-being, and the available response options.').'</p>
<p>'.__('There are many measures of biodiversity. Species richness (the number of species in a given area) represents a single but important metric that is valuable as the common currency of the diversity of life—but to fully capture biodiversity, it must be integrated with other metrics.').'</p>
</li>
<li><h4>'.__('How much is it worth?').'</h4>
<p>'.__('Unlike foods and other products that we buy in supermarkets, many ecosystem services have no price tag attached to them. This means that the importance of biodiversity and natural processes in providing benefits to people is ignored by financial markets. If the full economic value of these services was taken into account in decision-making, the degradation of ecosystem services could be significantly slowed down or even reversed.').'</p>
<p>'.__('This is what the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) study is working towards. The study aims at developing mechanisms to assess the value of nature, drawing attention to the global economic benefits of biodiversity and highlighting the growing costs of its loss. IUCN plays a central role in this work.').'</p>
<p>'.__('The results of the study have demonstrated clearly that the economic value of biodiversity and ecosystems is significant but still poorly recognized and inadequately reflected in public and private decisions. In order to build support for and guide efforts to reduce ecosystem degradation and halt biodiversity loss, more information and wider understanding is needed of the local and global benefits of ecosystem services, and of the full costs of restoration and conservation.').'</p>

	<dd><div id="box-editorial">The challenge of our time
Since 1900, the average global temperature has increased by 0.74°C. Humans are further changing the climate by their actions, especially through emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) which artificially warms the earth’s atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels is largely to blame.
Climate change will increasingly cause storms, droughts, floods and fires and have a severe impact on food production, water availability and ecosystems such as forests and wetlands. A major concern is how rapid climate change will magnify existing environmental stresses and contribute to food insecurity, conflict over resources, and loss of livelihood for millions of people.
Certain regions will be worse affected than others. Global warming is expected to be greatest over land and at high northern latitudes. The Arctic, Sub Saharan Africa, small islands and the big river deltas of Asia will be most seriously affected.
Those least responsible for global emissions, the poor and vulnerable in developing countries, are bearing the brunt of climate change impacts. It is a global responsibility to help these people adapt.
The world has a wide range of solutions that will help combat climate change. Protecting and better managing our natural resources is a cost-effective and efficient way to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions while we make the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon world in the coming decades. Natural resources can also help us adapt to the impacts of climate change we are already facing. It is an opportunity we cannot afford to pass up.
 
Some facts
According to the IPCC, if global average temperatures exceed 2°C there will be irreversible impacts on water, ecosystems, food, coastal zones and human health. We have a 50% chance of avoiding a 2°C warming if we stabilize greenhouse gases at 450 ppm CO2 eq (parts per million carbon dioxide equivalent). Recent evidence suggests even more rapid change, which will greatly, and in some case irreversibly, affect not just people, but also species and ecosystems. This means we must start radically reducing emissions now and stay on a low emissions pathway to avoid increasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.
 
Sea levels rose 20 cm last century
Glaciers, snow cover and sea ice are all declining
We are experiencing more heat‐waves, droughts and extreme rainfall and more intense tropical cyclones
Global temperature could rise by as much as 6.4°C by the end of the century
Up to 30% of plant and animal species could go extinct if the global temperature increase exceeds 1.5-2.5°C.
Arctic sea ice could disappear altogether during the summer by the second half of this century.
Crop yields in tropical zones could significantly decrease with even a modest (1-2°C) temperature increase.
One in six countries in the world faces food shortages each year because of severe droughts that could become semi-permanent under climate change.
The overall costs and risks of climate change will be equivalent to losing up to 20% of global GDP each year, while the costs of action now can be limited to around 1% of global GDP each year.</dd>

	<dd><div id="box-editorial">The conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity is the foundation of a sustainable economy. Water, food, shelter and energy are the building blocks upon which life and economic systems are built. The resilience of the global economy is intricately linked to the state of the environment.
Business also affects, and needs, biodiversity. Billions of people work in the private sector, and business is a key driver of social and economic development. Some are beginning to see the value of biodiversity, the need to protect it, and the need to invest in it. In the current global recession, with huge stimulus investments coming from governments, now, more than ever, we should be investing in nature to drive sustainable economic and social growth.

Some facts
Each year, we are losing ecosystem services worth an estimated EUR 50 billion from land-based ecosystems alone
 
The world’s commercial fisheries are likely to collapse in less than 50 years unless current trends are reversed
 
While 35% of the Earth’s surface is already dedicated to agriculture, irrigated crop production will need to increase by 80% by 2030 to match rising demand
 
In the Caribbean, the direct result of coral reef destruction has resulted in a 20% decline in tourism revenues (equal to approximately US$ 300 million per year)
 
Hundreds of medicinal plant species, whose naturally occurring chemicals make up the basis of all prescription drugs, are threatened with extinction.
 
New ‘green markets’ for organic agriculture, certified food and timber products are growing three times faster than the average, and could reach US$60 billion by 2010 
 
Around the world, it is estimated that protected areas could produce benefits, goods and ecosystem services worth between US$4,400 and US$5,200 billion a year. 
 
The overall costs and risks of climate change will be equivalent to losing up to 20% of global GDP each year, while the costs of action now can be limited to around 1% of global GDP each year
The global economic crisis, which is still having far-reaching consequences, has put pressure on world leaders to rethink their economic policies. In many cases, public and private investments are not in line with broader objectives of sustainability. Consequently, they often result in an over-exploitation of natural resources that compromises the long-term viability of the enterprise. The decline of the world’s fish stocks is a clear example of how misaligned policies can undermine an entire industry and the economy it supports.
A closer alignment of our economic and environment systems is an imperative that society can no longer afford to ignore. Critical steps in the necessary transition to a greener economy include:
• Achieve a fuller integration of biodiversity and ecosystem values into economic policy, finance and markets
Strengthen the biodiversity business case through the generation of knowledge and awareness on the different forms and contributions of biodiversity and ecosystem values.
Enhance the capacity of decision-makers to adequately account and manage for biodiversity and ecosystem values.
Help governments identify opportunities for generating employment and business opportunities through more sustainable policy planning and implementation.
• Empower private sector companies to lead the way to the development of more sustainable business models and practices
Develop best-practice guidance and standards for advancing sustainability in key industry sectors, such as agriculture, extractives, and tourism.
Explore and test alternative approaches for enhancing corporate sustainability, such as through full life-cycle analysis and innovating offsetting schemes.
• Make greater and smarter investments in nature-based markets and enterprises
Provide new channels for sustainable financing opportunities, such as through the development of a green development mechanism.
Encourage the establishment and growth of innovative markets for public environmental goods and services, such as trading in carbon credits and banking of wetlands.
Support the development of sustainable enterprises in areas such as renewable energy, organic agriculture and ecotourism.
Encourage the enhanced appreciation of the climate regulating functions of ecosystems; such as through REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation).</dd>

While the planet heats up, so does the energy debate: the media is full of volatile oil prices; disputes over gas supplies; a resurgence of nuclear power, renewable energy targets and so on. Alternative energy markets are expanding as the world tries to shed its reliance on fossil fuels while still meeting growing global energy demand.').'</p>
<p>'.__('Our systems of energy production, distribution and consumption are changing rapidly and this is having a major impact on ecosystems, which underpin many of our energy supplies. While climate change is the most significant indirect impact on biodiversity from energy production and consumption, direct impacts continue to take a major toll. Pipeline construction, coal mining and fuelwood extraction all degrade habitat. And there is no sign of a let-up. The 2009 World Energy Outlook warns that global energy demand could increase by more than half from 2004 to 2030 with fossil fuels likely to dominate the global energy mix until 2030. But just because there’s plenty of oil and coal left, this shouldn’t mean we delay the switch to cleaner alternatives.').'</p></dd>
